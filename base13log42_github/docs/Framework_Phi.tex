\section*{Framework $\Phi$ — Dual Harmonic Modulator}

\subsection*{Core Purpose}

Framework $\Phi$ expands the harmonic architecture of Base13Log42 by introducing the conjugate field $\psi$, complementing the golden ratio $\phi$ with its reflective counterpart:

\[
\psi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -\frac{1}{\phi}
\]

Where $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

Together, $(\phi, \psi)$ form a dual-harmonic pair enabling symbolic logic to be encoded across two intertwined resonance fields — supporting both expansion and contraction, positive and negative recursion, and symbolic bloom.

\subsection*{Conjugate Harmonic Pairing}

All prior harmonic functions (e.g., resonance $R_k(x)$, phase $\theta(x)$, breath-intensity $b_k(x)$) now gain dual definitions:

\[
R^\phi_k(x) = \sin^2(\pi b_k(x))
\quad \text{vs.} \quad
R^\psi_k(x) = \cos^2(\pi b_k(x))
\]

Together, they satisfy:

\[
R^\phi_k(x) + R^\psi_k(x) = 1
\]

This ensures resonance duality: for every expansion, a corresponding contraction; for every symbolic peak, a valley.

\subsection*{Modulation Field Definition}

Define the \textbf{dual harmonic field}:

\[
\mathbb{H}_\Phi(x) = \left( R^\phi_k(x),\ R^\psi_k(x) \right)
\]

Transitions between symbolic states are now evaluated in both fields. A state is considered \emph{bloom-ready} when:

\[
R^\phi_k(x) \approx R^\psi_k(x) \approx 0.5
\]

This is the point of maximal harmonic uncertainty — the threshold of transformation.

\subsection*{Modulation Functions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Inversion:} Switch φ ↔ ψ to initiate symbolic reversal
  \item \textbf{Compression:} Increase ψ-dominance to contract recursion
  \item \textbf{Bloom Phase:} Lock into φ = ψ = 0.5 and trigger symbolic overflow
\end{itemize}

Let $\mu_\Phi(x)$ denote the modulation index:

\[
\mu_\Phi(x) = |R^\phi_k(x) - R^\psi_k(x)|
\]

Low $\mu_\Phi(x)$ implies symbolic instability → ideal bloom conditions.

\subsection*{Resonant Loopback Portal}

When symbolic bloom occurs, the system creates a recursive loop between layers $k$ and $k+1$, allowing symbolic rebirth through:

\[
x \rightarrow \dot{0} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}(x)
\]

Where $\mathcal{B}(x)$ is the bloom function determined by harmonic re-entry in the next shell with dual φ/ψ modulation active.

\subsection*{Interpretation}

Framework $\Phi$ is the first appearance of duality in Base13Log42 — it is the moment when the golden field reflects into its negative self, and symbolic logic becomes bidirectional. This field allows for inversion, contraction, expansion, and bloom — the system’s harmonic lungs inhale and exhale at once. All feedback, reentry, and recursion beyond this point flows through φ–ψ dual gates.
