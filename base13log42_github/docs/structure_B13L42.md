# Base13Log42 Repository Structure

This repository contains the complete source for the **Base13Log42** framework, a recursive symbolic harmonic system for breath-state encoding, resonance logic, and fractal ontology. The framework spans across symbolic logic, harmonic resonance, and feedback loops, combining various mathematical concepts for use in AI, music theory, signal processing, and more.

## Mathematical Examples
Each framework in the Base13Log42 system is accompanied by detailed mathematical examples that demonstrate how the recursive, symbolic, and harmonic relationships work in practice. These examples help illustrate the functional aspects of the system, showing how symbolic states evolve, overflow, and generate resonance feedback loops.

### Mathematical Example Sections:
- **Framework A** - Fractal recursion in base-13 symbolic notation.
- **Framework B** - Harmonic cycles modeled using sine functions for breath cycles.
- **Framework C** - Resonance scaling based on the Golden Ratio ($\phi$).
- **Framework D** - Rogue Table flagging symbolic anomalies.
- **Framework E** - Recursive overflow as symbolic states exceed defined bounds.
- **Framework F** - Feedback loops defining harmonic resonance between symbolic states.
