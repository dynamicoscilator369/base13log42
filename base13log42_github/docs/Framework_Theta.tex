\section*{Framework $\Theta$ — Threshold Engine}

\subsection*{Core Purpose}

Framework $\Theta$ defines the bifurcation logic of Base13Log42 — the engine that detects symbolic instability, convergence, or resonance crisis and forces the system to transition into new logical or harmonic modes. When the cumulative and differential layers (Frameworks $\Sigma$ and $\nabla$) report sustained or accelerating deviation, $\Theta$ evaluates whether a threshold has been crossed and initiates appropriate symbolic action.

It is the symbolic decision gateway — the crossing point between continuation, collapse, overflow, or rebirth.

\subsection*{Threshold Functions}

Let $x_t$ be a symbolic state in shell $k$ at time $t$.

Define the primary convergence evaluation:

\[
\mathcal{T}_1(x) = \Sigma_t(x) > \Theta_\Sigma
\]

And the dynamic instability evaluation:

\[
\mathcal{T}_2(x) = \nabla_t(x) > \eta
\quad \text{or} \quad \nabla^2_t(x) > \kappa
\]

When either threshold is met, the system transitions into a new symbolic mode.

\subsection*{Symbolic Transition Protocol}

Let $\Theta(x_t)$ define the outcome function:

\[
\Theta(x_t) =
\begin{cases}
\text{Continue} & \text{if thresholds not exceeded} \\
\text{Overflow (to shell } k+1) & \text{if } \mathcal{T}_1(x) \text{ is exceeded only} \\
\text{Collapse → } \dot{0} & \text{if } \mathcal{T}_2(x) \text{ is large or accelerating} \\
\text{Bloom trigger} & \text{if both } \mathcal{T}_1, \mathcal{T}_2 \text{ exceed at resonance peak}
\end{cases}
\]

This protocol governs the symbolic fate of each state based on harmonic feedback and temporal trends.

\subsection*{Context-Aware Modulation}

The Threshold Engine can adjust its sensitivity dynamically depending on:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Shell level $
