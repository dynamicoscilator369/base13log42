\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Base13Log42 Lean Framework\
\
## Overview\
\
Base13Log42 is a symbolic system designed to model recursive processes using harmonic resonance and fractal mathematics. This Lean repository provides formal representations of the system's core concepts, including symbolic state transitions, resonance scaling, and breath-cycle feedback loops. The framework is designed for use in fields such as symbolic AI, signal processing, and mathematical modeling of complex recursive systems.\
\
## Structure\
\
This folder contains the Lean code that implements the Base13Log42 system. It includes definitions for symbolic states, recursive evolution, resonance logic, and feedback loops:\
\
- **base13log42.lean**: Contains the core definitions for the symbolic states, resonance logic, and recursive cycles.\
- **test.lean**: Provides tests for validating the behavior of the Base13Log42 system, including resonance computations and state transitions.\
- **evolve_system.lean**: Defines the recursive evolution of the system and the simulation of state changes over time based on the `breath_cycle`.\
- **feedback_system.lean**: Implements a feedback mechanism to adjust the resonance based on state transitions.\
- **appendices.lean**: Contains supporting material and additional frameworks that extend the core system, providing deeper insights into its functionality.\
\
## Key Concepts\
\
### Symbolic States\
Base13Log42 operates on a base-12 symbolic system with states ranging from `1` to `C`. Each symbolic state represents a distinct value in the system, and transitions between states are cyclic.\
\
### Resonance\
The resonance is based on the Golden Ratio (\uc0\u966 ), scaling with the state\'92s position and recursive depth. Resonance is computed as:\
\
```lean\
def resonance (state : SymbolicState) (n : \uc0\u8469 ) : \u8477  :=\
  phi^n * (nat.cast (framework_A state) : \uc0\u8477 )\

# Base13Log42 Lean Framework\
\
## Overview\
This folder contains the Lean formalizations of the Base13Log42 system. It encodes symbolic recursion, harmonic feedback, and fractal state transitions in Lean, allowing mathematical exploration and proof of the system\'92s recursive logic.\
\
## Files\
\
### `base13log42.lean`\
Core logic of the symbolic system:\
- Defines `SymbolicState` (1 to C)\
- State transitions via `next_symbol`\
- Resonance using \uc0\u966 -based scaling\
- Breath-cycle oscillator\
- Full integration in `evolve_system` and `feedback_system`\
\
### `test.lean`\
Verifies:\
- Symbol transition behavior\
- Resonance math\
- Breath-driven cycles\
- Overflow resets and recursion\
\
### `appendices.lean`\
Contains formal versions of Frameworks A\'96\uc0\u8734 :\
- `Framework_A`: Fractal hierarchy\
- `Framework_B`: Symbolic breath oscillator\
- Through to `Framework_\uc0\u8734 `: \'c6ther convergence logic\
\
### `readme.md` (this file)\
Introductory overview and navigation for the Lean logic system.\
\
## Usage\
To use:\
1. Load `base13log42.lean` into Lean.\
2. Step through `test.lean` for behavior validation.\
3. Expand or modify frameworks via `appendices.lean`.\
\
All functions are pure and symbolic. Great for proving recursive properties and exploring \uc0\u966 -resonant logic structures.\
